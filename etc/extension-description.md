This extension adds a bunch of keybindings for Todoist.  In particular, it adds a cursor in the task view which can be moved via the arrow keys or j / k / h / l (vim style keys).  Many of the keybindings are inspired by gmail's keyboard shortcuts, so those that are familiar with those will find it very easy to get used to it.

Currently it provides keybindings for most non-premium features you might want to use, including: task completion, archival, deletion, setting priority, setting project, rescheduling, changing ordering, changing indent levels, and more.
